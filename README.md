# Capstone-1---Boston-Crime

## Problem Statement

The following report examines crime incident reports provided by the Boston Police Department's new crime incident report system for the years 2015 to 2018. The data set documents the initial details surrounding an incident to which BPD officers respond, focused on capturing the type of incident as well as when and where it occurred. Time of day (in hours), location (latitude and longitude), day of the week, crime type, as well as some user generated statistics, like 'gun crime radius' and 'gun crime distance' will be used in the analysis. All data made available by Kaggle, provided by Analyze Boston.
